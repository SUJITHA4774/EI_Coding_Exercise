# EI_Coding_Exercise

In my GitHub repository, under the master branch there is Exercise 2, and the remaining branches are based on Design Patterns. 
Under Behavioral Patterns, I have implemented the Observer case; under Structural Patterns, I have implemented the Decorator and Flyweight cases; and 
Under Creational Patterns, I have implemented the Singleton and Factory cases.
